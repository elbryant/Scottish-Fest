        <p>Scottish Fest is the oldest and largest festival of its kind in the Southern California area.  The festival occurs annually on Memorial Day Weekend at the Orange County Fair and Event Center located in Costa Mesa, California.</p>
 
        <p>The festival was established in 1932 and was called a Highland Games in the tradition of it's Scottish heritage. It began as a small gathering in 1932 but as the years grew so did the Games. We continue the tradition of hosting these games to this day.</p>
